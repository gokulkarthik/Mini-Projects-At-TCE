I wont talk much about the specifications as it is already clearly mentioned on flipkart. I will share only my experience with this device.

I am using the phone from last 1 and half month. Will break down my review in 3 parts. The pros, cons and what more could be done.
First let's see the pros that make it the best value for money phone currently in the market.

* Battery : easily getting around 6 hours of screen on time. Battery is an issue with smartphones today. This phone is just a beas...

Good chinese Product.

My comparison with redmi note 3 and some drawbacks i saw in lenovo are
1. IR blaster in redmi note3 but lenovo doesn't
2. 4k video playable in redmi note3 but lenovo doesn't
3. Battery 3500mah where redmi note3 have 4100mah

5. Notification LED light blinks only red & Blue in k5 but in redmi note 3 blinks all colors.
6. Downloading speed is good in redmi note3.

Good phone; competitive price; HARDWARE issues: BAD service
Short description: Great phone, great price, but be prepared to face touch-screen/hardware issues and a lousy customer service as well. :-(

Phone (4 stars):
a) The phone looks fabulous. It's got some nice features too - lot of internal space, 4 GB RAM, fingerprint sensor, VR compatibility, etc.
b) For the first couple of weeks, I didn't observe any issues with the phone, but after that there were severe touch-screen issues (explained below).

Lenovo vibe note 5 awesome with few constraints
Pros.
1. Great speed for multi tasking
2. Amazing camera clarity
3. Sleek look and lightweight

Cons.
1. Battery can't be removed
2. 2 sim slots is fine, but apart from that memory can't be inserted. Would have been better if memory card slot is in place apart from 2 sim slots.

OK, since last couple of days it has gone into a hang state multiple times. And I am forced to restart it by long pressing the power button. Don't know what happened suddenly?!

After installing the Nova launcher, no issues yet. So may be it was the Lenovo UI launcher, I suppose. Note:...

Everything is ok except for the Hybrid SIM.
Nice phone. Good build quality. Premium looks. Works smooth without any lags. Network reception is good. Fingerprint scanner works very well. Battery life is simply awesome, easily lasts a day with moderate to heavy usage. The only disappointing thing is that it doesn't have a dedicated external SD card slot. The Hybrid SIM slot can be used for either SIM card or an SD card. Otherwise everything is just awesome.

A Best Phone From Lenovo
WHAT I LIKED
Good build quality
Solid metal unibody design and brushed metal finish - feels good to hold
Smaller and slimmer than the K4 Note
Bundled clear cover for protecting the phone
Good display - solid brightness levels, contrast ratio, sunlight legibility and viewing angles
Display has Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection unlike the K4 Note
Lenovo’s Vibe UI is clean, and at the same time adds some useful features on top of Android
Good speed/performance, including with games
Multitasking...

Simply awesome
Review after 1 month of usage... - So Far, So GREAT! 


People say don't buy Lenovo phones, but trust me guys... This isn't like other devices. 
The Helio P10 processor from MediaTek, the 4 GB RAM has taken this phone's performance to an entirely different level... It performs at par with the 20000 Rs phone available from the bigger popular brands. 

The rear camera is satisfactory (not poor!) , but the selfie camera is great. The location of Fingerprint sensor on the back makes it ea...

Great Deal.....
I have received my mobile on next day from the order dtae. Great service from Flipkart. Coming to the performance of Phone.

1. Touch is smooth and clean UI.
2. I have installed Asphalt 8 and played continuously for 1 Hour, I didn't see any lag. Awesome performance.
3. Both cameras looks decent.

I am yet to receive ANT VR BOX, excited to experience the VR with my Lenovo Vibe..

Wonderful experience
Initial impressions on the phone are very good. Display is top notch. 4GB RAM comes in handy seen with almost 50Apps running you have 2GB free which will help you with multi task and play heavy graphic games with ease.Front Camera has seen improvement from k4 which in itself was truly beautiful. Back camera is decent. No other phone in market will give you 4GB RAM and 32GB internal memory for 13.5K . Go for it without second thought. Hybrid Sim slots and speaker moving to back is a step ba...

Super Awesome Phone
Looking for a budget phone with good spec. Stumbled upon lenovo K5 vibe note 4gb variant on flipkart got a good exchange rate for my old phone grabbed deal. Delivery was super fast got the phone undamaged. I have been using this phone for past 3 days the performance is good and mostly satisfies my expectations. Camera is too good but considering the price it is very much acceptable. Played few hi config games ,performance was too good no hanging issues was found.

Ph in this price range and these feature are awesome. For others u may have to pay double. Camera Quality is just next to iphone. Phone speed is also good. Look nice. & battery 3500mah is powerful. Front Camera with 8mp is rare & picrures clear..I like this price range as u use it for 1yr , technology upgrade & take another one.

This is very good mobile phone and performance wise it's too good.

However, Lenovo missed very common features.

Feature rich phone for the money
I have been using the Samsung Galaxy E5 for the last one and half years I grabbed the offer of Flipkart to exchange it for Lenovo Vibe K5 Note without thinking much. Added benefit I got 10% off using SBI debit card to pay for it. Total bill was approximately 8.2k with Ant VR which comes at a price of ₹500 if baught togather with the this phone. The very first difference I felt was the weight and slimness. My E5 was noticeably lighter (148g) and slimmer than K5 Note (165g without any cover o...

Go for it without thinking anything else. Great performance, and the theater max exp is simply awesome. Good battery life. Camera quality good in day. In night, you can see some noise. Gaming exp is simply awesome. I ordered a Amkette Evo Pro 2 controller and gaming has been awesome.

Utterly Disappointed
I was excited about the phone by its main features like processor and all that but when I got this phone then I came to know that you can only put one sim with one external memory card or two sim.and one more thing that the data consumption is more in this phone. Battery backup is also not like we were expecting.

Good Product except the GPS Issue
Overall good value for money. But the GPS is taking too much of time to get the exact location. If you are a person depending Google maps for travelling this will irritate you for sure.If you search in google you can see many Lenovo K5 users facing same issue. I am giving 1 rating just because to make people read my comment..it should be actually 4*.
